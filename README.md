# SW-92 Wankel Design
SolidWorks models of the SW92 Wankel Engine

## About
Several years ago I commissioned an engineering student at Georgia Tech (@tir38) to create a SolidWorks model from the SW-92 Wankel engine plans, excluding only common DIN parts like nuts, bolts, washers and screws.  I don't know if the plans are still available, 
but due to copyright concerns I am not comfortable placing a scanned copy of the purchased print on this repo.

Since my plans for the SW-92 were scrapped, I have decided that other engineering geeks might be interested in the model 
in modern CAD format (as opposed to the original hand-drafted plats).  I hope someone finds it useful!

As of Aug 21, 2017. it appears that the [project site](https://jasonatwood.io/archives/73) is still alive, and still getting comments!
